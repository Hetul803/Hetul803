## Hi, I'm Hetul 👋

I'm a systems engineer focused on building **AI infrastructure**, **vector retrieval systems**, and **quantitative research platforms**.

My work centers on designing performance-critical backend systems, large-scale experimentation pipelines, and infrastructure for intelligent decision-making under uncertainty.

## 🔧 What I'm working on

### **Veclite — Hierarchical Vector Routing & Retrieval Engine**
A production-ready vector database that improves efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

- Achieves **12.71× compression** with **exact recall parity** vs FAISS (Recall@10 = 0.921)
- Two-stage retrieval: **cluster-based routing + exact reranking**
- Sub-40ms latency at 100K+ vector scale under concurrent query load
- Built with FastAPI, Redis, PostgreSQL, and a multi-tenant SaaS backend

### **GSIN — Global Strategy Intelligence Network**
A self-evolving algorithmic trading research platform for systematic strategy discovery.

- Continuously backtests and mutates **300–1,000+ strategies** per cycle
- Genetic-algorithm-driven evolution with regime-aware mutation
- Research-grade evaluation using walk-forward analysis and Monte Carlo simulations
- Internal paper-trading system for candidate strategy validation
